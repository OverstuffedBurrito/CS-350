# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to create a thermostat that read temperatures and activate led's representing modes on a thermostat according to the set temperature. 

What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I handled the activation of the cooling or heating depending on the temp point set well. 

Where could you improve?
I believe I could improve the refresh rate and information display so that The user gets real time feedback when pressing a button.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I have gotten into creating my own server to host media such as photos movies and shows as well as setting up a backup system. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Using the shell in this project to interact with the raspberry pi has given me confidence to add packages and even edit python files all within the shell. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By creating reusable objects that I can review at a later time I can then take the code written and apply it to future projects and even other raspberry pi projects.
